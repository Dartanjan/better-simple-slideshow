# A Better Simple Slideshow
This is a fairly basic slideshow, written in javascript .

## Features
* fully responsive
* option for auto-advancing slides, or manually advancing by user
* multiple slideshows per-page
* supports arrow-key navigation
* full-screen toggle using HTML5 fullscreen api
* swipe events supported on touch devices (requires [hammer.js](https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer.js))
* written in vanilla JS--no jQuery dependency (much :sparkling_heart: for [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) though!)
